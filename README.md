## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Python 3.11+** — [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
- **Hermes Agent (with WebAPI)** — see below

### Step 1: Set up Hermes Agent (backend)

> **⚠️ Important:** Hermes Workspace requires the **WebAPI backend** (`hermes webapi`), which provides the FastAPI server with session management, chat streaming, skills, and memory endpoints. The upstream NousResearch/hermes-agent does not include this yet — use our fork which adds the WebAPI layer.

```bash
# Clone the fork with WebAPI support
git clone https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-agent.git
cd hermes-agent
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .

# Run the interactive setup (configures your API keys)
hermes setup

# Start the WebAPI server on port 8642
hermes webapi
# Or manually: uvicorn webapi.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8642
```

> **Using upstream hermes-agent?** The workspace will still load — it auto-detects which API endpoints your gateway supports and gracefully disables features that aren't available. You'll see a log message listing which APIs are missing. For full functionality (chat, sessions, skills, memory), use our fork.

> **API keys:** Hermes supports Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, OpenRouter, and local models via Ollama. Run `hermes setup` to configure your provider, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `~/.hermes/.env`.

### Step 2: Install & Run Hermes Workspace (frontend)

```bash
# In a new terminal
git clone https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace.git
cd hermes-workspace
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
printf '\nHERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642\n' >> .env
pnpm dev                   # Starts on http://localhost:3000
```

> **Verify:** Open `http://localhost:3000` — you should see the chat interface. If you get connection errors, make sure Hermes Agent is running on port 8642 (`curl http://localhost:8642/health` should return `{"status": "ok"}`).

### Environment Variables

```env
# Anthropic key for Hermes Agent (optional for demo mode, required for chat)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here

# Hermes FastAPI backend URL
HERMES_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8642

# Optional: password-protect the web UI
# HERMES_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## 🐳 Docker Quickstart

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub%20Codespaces-Open-181717?logo=github)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=outsourc-e/hermes-workspace)

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**
- **Docker Compose**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace.git
cd hermes-workspace
cp .env.example .env   # Edit with your API key
docker compose up
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

> **Supports any provider:** Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, or local models via Ollama (no key needed). Just set the right env var in `.env` — see `.env.example` for options.

## 📡 Mobile Access via Tailscale

Access Hermes Workspace from anywhere on your devices — no port forwarding, no VPN complexity.

### Setup

1. **Install Tailscale** on your Mac and mobile device:
   - Mac: [tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)
   - iPhone/Android: Search "Tailscale" in the App Store / Play Store

2. **Sign in** to the same Tailscale account on both devices

3. **Find your Mac's Tailscale IP:**
   ```bash
   tailscale ip -4
   # Example output: 100.x.x.x
   ```

4. **Open Hermes Workspace on your phone:**
   ```
   http://100.x.x.x:3000
   ```

5. **Add to Home Screen** using the steps above for the full app experience

> 💡 Tailscale works over any network — home wifi, mobile data, even across countries. Your traffic stays end-to-end encrypted.

## 🖥️ Native Desktop App

> **Status: In Development** — A native Electron-based desktop app is in active development.

The desktop app will offer:
- Native window management and tray icon
- System notifications for agent events and mission completions
- Auto-launch on startup
- Deep OS integration (macOS menu bar, Windows taskbar)

**In the meantime:** Install Hermes Workspace as a PWA (see above) for a near-native desktop experience — it works great.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Workspace loads but chat doesn't work"

The workspace auto-detects your gateway's capabilities on startup. Check your terminal for a line like:

```
[gateway] http://127.0.0.1:8642 available: health, models; missing: sessions, skills, memory, config, jobs
[gateway] Missing Hermes APIs detected. Update Hermes: cd hermes-agent && git pull && pip install -e . && hermes gateway
```

**Fix:** You need the WebAPI backend. Use our fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-agent.git
cd hermes-agent && pip install -e . && hermes webapi
```

### "Connection refused" or workspace hangs on load

Your Hermes gateway isn't running. Start it:
```bash
cd hermes-agent
source .venv/bin/activate
hermes webapi
```

Verify: `curl http://localhost:8642/health` should return `{"status": "ok"}`.

### "Using upstream NousResearch/hermes-agent"

The upstream hermes-agent doesn't include the WebAPI server yet. The workspace will load but with limited functionality. For full features, switch to our fork (`outsourc-e/hermes-agent`).
